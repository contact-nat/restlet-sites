Restlet Studio provides a three-tab view of your API. You can craft your API from the **Web API** tab and then have a look at the Swagger or RAML format generated in the **Swagger** and **RAML** tabs.

>**Note:** Swagger and RAML tabs are in Read-only mode. You can copy and paste the code generated if necessary.

To visualize your API structure, browse through the different sections in the left panel: the content of each section displays in the **Web API** tab of the central panel.
