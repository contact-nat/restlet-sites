# Introduction

You can share your API definitions with members of your team who can also share their API definitions with you.

So you can decide to create an API definition and keep it private by setting its visibility to *Private*. You can also be willing to share it with your team. The last option is to share it with another team you belong to by transferring its ownership to the team owner.

The API visibility can be modified from the [General information panel](/technical-resources/restlet-studio/guide/craft/general-info "General information panel") or from the [APIs page](/technical-resources/restlet-studio/guide/share/manage-apis "APIs page").


>**Note:** Sharing APIs is only available with a Team or a Scale plan. Downgrading to Solo plan will automatically make all your APIs private.

# Change visibility

Navigate to the General Information section of an API or to your APIs page (**APIs** / **My APIs**).  
Click **Change**.
