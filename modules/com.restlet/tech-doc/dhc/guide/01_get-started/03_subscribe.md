# DHC Base plans

## Plans overview

As you subscribe to DHC, you can choose between different base plan levels as defined in our <a href="http://restlet.com/products/apispark/pricing" target="_blank">Pricing page</a>. Each level includes a number of features associated to it. Of course you can switch to a higher or lower plan at any time.
