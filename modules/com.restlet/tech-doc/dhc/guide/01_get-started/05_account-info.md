Your account page is composed of four tabs: **Profile**, **Billing**, **Team** and **Sign out**.

# Profile

![Profile tab](images/profile-tab.jpg "Profile tab")

 The **Profile tab** gives you information about your profile including your email address and your profile picture.

# <a class="anchor" name="billing"></a>Billing

![Billing tab](images/billing-tab.jpg "Billing tab")

The **Billing tab** gives you information about the plan you subscribed to (type and price/month), your credit card details (type and expiration date) and your Maven license key.

From this tab, you can switch to another plan by clicking the **Change plan** button. You can also change the credit card you registered by clicking the **Update payment method** button or you can copy your **Maven license key**.

# Team

![Team tab](images/team-tab.jpg "Team tab")

If you subscribed to a Team plan or a Scale plan, then you can add members to your Team.

The **Team** tab gives you a list of the different members of your team (with their email address and provider). You appear as the *owner* and your team members can be removed from the team.  

Provided your [plan](./subscribe "plans") allows it, you can add new members by entering their email address in the input field at the bottom of the page.
A progress bar indicates whether you can still add new members e.g. 2/5.

# Sign out

Click on the **Sign out** tab to sign out.
