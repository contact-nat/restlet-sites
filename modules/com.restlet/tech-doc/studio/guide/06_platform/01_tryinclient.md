During the implementation phase of your API project, you'll regularly need to interact with you API to verify its behavior.

Once the API is implemented, consumers will also need to explore the APIs capabilities as they work on their client implementation.

For both of these purposes, Restlet Studio includes a "Try in Restlet Client" button, both in the editor view, and published documentation.

You can either export your whole API definition into Client or a single operation.

## Try an API in Restlet Client

Try in Restlet Client from the editor:

Try in Restlet Client from published documentation:

Clicking the Try in Restlet Client button will open Restlet Client, Restlet's API testing tool, in order to import the whole set of operations of the chosen API. You will then be able to set up complex scenarios that emulate real-life usages of your API.
More details can be found [here](../../../client/user-guide/platform/tryinclient).

If you have not yet installed Restlet Client, you will be taken to the chrome store to install it. Note that once you have a Restlet account, you automatically have access to all modules, including Restlet Client and Restlet Cloud, with the same account.
