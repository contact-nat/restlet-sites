During the implementation phase of your API project, you'll regularly need to interact with you API to verify its behavior.

Once the API is implemented, consumers will also need to explore the APIs capabilities as they work on their client implementation.

For both of these purposes, Restlet Studio includes a "Try in Restlet Client" button, both in the editor view, and published documentation.

Try in Restlet Client from the editor:

Try in Restlet Client from published documentation:

Clicking the Try in Restlet Client button will open Restlet Client, Restlet's API testing tool, with a ready-to-go request on the chosen API operation.

If you have not yet installed Restlet Client, you will be taken to the chrome store to install it. Note that once you have a Restlet account, you automatically have access to Restlet Client (APISpark) with the same account.
