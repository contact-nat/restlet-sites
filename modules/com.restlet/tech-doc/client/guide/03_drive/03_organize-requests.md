Of course you can define one-shot requests, but another interesting approach consists of reusing and even sharing them.

# Description

Restlet Client allows you to build projects inside your drive.
The different items you can save in your drive follow this pattern:

<i class="fa fa-cloud"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;project  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i class="fa fa-cog"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;service  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i class="fa fa-rocket"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;scenario  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i class="fa fa-paper-plane"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;request

>**Note:** Each item can be created at the root of your drive. A [scenario](../run-tests/scenarios "scenario") can only contain requests.

# Save your requests inside projects

Once a request is created and named, Restlet Client lets you save it.  
You can save it at the root of your drive or you can classify your requests inside structured projects (folders) and services (subfolders).

To save your request inside a project:

Create your request.  
Enter a name in the input field on top of the screen.  
Click **Save** on the right of this field.  

## Save your request in an existing project

Select **My drive** in the **Path** drop-down menu.
Select the appropriate project (and possibly the service) in which you want to save your request and click **Save**.

>**Note:** The **Path** displays as you browse through your drive and it is clickable.
![Save request](images/save-request-path.jpg "Save request")

## Save your request in a new project

Select **My drive** in the **Path** drop-down menu.
Click **Create** and select **Project**.

![Save request](images/save-request-in-new-project.jpg "Save request")

Enter a name for your **Project** and click **Add**.

![Save request](images/save-request-add-project.jpg "Save request")

>**Note:** You can then just as well add a Service and a Scenario inside that project.
![Save request](images/save-request-path2.jpg "Save request")

Click **Save** to add the request in your new project.
