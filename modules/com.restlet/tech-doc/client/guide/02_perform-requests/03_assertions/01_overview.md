Restlet Client allows you to execute HTTP requests, but it also allows you to apply rules on calls to check that the responses received correspond to what you expect.

Restlet Client's tests are based on *Assertions*. Assertions aim at determining if calls match what is expected to be returned by the API under test.

>**Note:** You can easily build assertions with the [expression builder](../expressions/overview "Expression builder").
