# Description

The History of the requests you launched is accessible from the left & the bottom panels.  
The left panel organizes requests per API.  
The bottom panel displays the date and time of the request.  
Both panels display the operation type (GET, POST, etc.), the request URI, the response status code and its duration.  
They also provide a **Search** field that will allow you to search requests you have made earlier.
