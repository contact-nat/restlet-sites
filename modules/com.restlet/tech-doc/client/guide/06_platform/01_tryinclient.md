<a href="https://studio.restlet.com" target="_blank">Restlet Studio <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> - the leading API contract editor - is one the tools of the Restlet Platform. In a nutshell, this online tool allows you to fully describe the contract of your API.

We've implemented an integrated import from Restlet Studio to Restlet Client. You just have one button to click there to import your API in Restlet Client. You will find more information about this integration [here](../../../studio/user-guide/platform/tryinclient).
