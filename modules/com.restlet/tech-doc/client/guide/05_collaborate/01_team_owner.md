As a Restlet user, you'll have one team assigned to your account. 
This team will be used across Restlet Client, Restlet Studio, and Restlet Cloud.

To access your team, open the **Team** menu from the profile drop-down menu in the header bar.
If this is the first time you open it, you are the only member of the team. And you are the **team owner**. 

To add people to your team, search them by email. Then, if they are not already a user of Restlet products,
they will receive an invitation to join your team.

# Sharing projects
 
Now, let's share a project with your team. On the left menu of the application, click on a project's menu to use the **Share** action. 
Then, you set the project's **access to Team**. Once a project is shared with your team members, it is displayed in green.
 
From now on, your [team members](./team_member) will see the _shared project_ appear in their left menu, as a new entry under your name.

# Limitations and best practices

We suggest avoiding very large projects. Small or medium-sized projects provide more flexibility, a better control and great performance.

We recommend having up to 500 requests by project. You can create as many projects as you need.
