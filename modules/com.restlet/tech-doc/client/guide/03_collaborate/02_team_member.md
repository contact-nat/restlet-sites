# As a team member, I want to add a project to a team I belong to

As a team member, you can see to which teams you belong to in the repository view.

The team owner shares projects with you. Nonetheless you can also share projects with the team.

In your repository, click on a project's menu to use the *Share* action.

Then, you'll have to set the project's visibility to the team you want.

Note that, here, the sharing is about transferring the project to the team. 
This implies you will lose the project's management, such as the delete action. 
Indeed, it will be the team owner that will be able to manage the project.  

Once a project is shared, it is transferred to the team.

From now on, the team owner will see the project appear and marked as a shared project.
