This whole section is about what we call "Discovery". It denotes a kind of activity where users that discover an API simply send requests and get responses.

When can still get a little bit further and complete the use case. Let's say that you want to check some basic assumptions. For example, ensure that all requests to my API lasts less then a specific amount of milliseconds.

Restlet Client covers this need using "assertions". Assertions are deeply described in [next part of the user guide](../test-automate/validate-http-responses).

Havind said that, it's worth telling you that when a request is run and loaded later from the history, assertions are recovered too.

Assertions are available from the "Assertions" pane at the bottom of the "Requests" perspective page.
