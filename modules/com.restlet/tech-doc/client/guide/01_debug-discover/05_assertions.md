This whole section is about what we call "Discovery". It denotes a kind of activity where users that discover an API simply send requests and get responses.
Some other people don't discover an API, they actually know what is the API, and they even make sure that the API complies with rules and follows initial design.
This activity will be covered in details in the [next section](../test-automate/run-request-sets).

When we think of these activities, we rapidly understand that some intermediary activities exist. People can discover APIs, but check at a glance that the response is more or less not usual.
Some other can record requests and make sure that the response meet requirements across the time.
Then emerges the need to describe requirements and validate them each time the request is run. Restlet Client covers this need using "assertions".
Assertions are deeply described in [next part of the user guide](../test-automate/validate-http-responses), but we wanted to point out that assertions are also part of the discovery activity.

Assertions are available from the "Assertions" pane at the bottom of the "Requests" perspective page.
