Internal connectors
===================

Here is the list of connectors built-in the Restlet engine:

-   [Local](local.md "Local connectors")
-   [FILE](local.md "File connector")
-   [CLAP](clap.md "CLAP connector")
-   [HTTP](http.md "HTTP connector (internal)")
-   [RIAP](riap.md "Restlet Internal Access Protocol")
-   Zip

Note that those connectors available in the engine JAR but still need to
be declared in your Restlet component, otherwise your applications won't
be able to use them!
