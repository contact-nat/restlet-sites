This extension provides several tools that can be used either in standalone mode within Restlet Framework or integrated
with [Restlet Cloud](https://cloud.restlet.com/), PaaS for web API for extended features.

Here are the main two features provided:

* [Introspector](./introspector), a tool to extract the web API definition of your Restlet
API or JAX-RS API based application and push it to Restlet Cloud to provide documentation and tooling.

* [Firewall](./firewall), a service that adds rate limitation to your web API.
