# Requirements

In order to test and debug a web API, a certain number of requirements must be met.

The API must be deployed. Please visit the [Cell deployment](technical-resources/apispark/guide/explore/cell-deployment "Cell deployment") page if you do not know how to deploy an API.  
You need access credentials if the API if not open to *Anyone*. Please visit the [Invocation](technical-resources/apispark/guide/publish/publish/invocation "Invocation") page if you do not know how to obtain and view your API access credentials.

# Invoke a Web API with POSTMAN

Using a web API does not impose any particular programming language. It can even be done from a web browser. However, to test your API we recommend the use of tools such as the Chrome extension POSTMAN and DHC that provide a graphical user interface to perform HTTP calls.

When using POSTMAN, click on the **Basic Auth** tab, fill in the **Username** and **Password** fields with the information copied from your APISpark **Endpoints**.  
Fill in the **Endpoint URI** and add the name of a resource e.g. `/contacts/ `at the end of it. (E.g. `https://employeedirectory.apispark.net/v1/contacts`).  
To retrieve the list of contacts in JSON, click on the **Headers** button on the far right and input the **Accept** command in the **Header** field and write **application/json** in the **Value** field opposite.  
Click on the **Send** button.

# Check your messages

The web API's **Messages** tab displays messages pertaining to different aspects of your API's life.

This is a great place to go to when testing your API.

## Messages

The **Messages** section in the left panel contains general messages pertaining to APISpark internal process such as version creation, and deployment.

## Traces

The **Traces** section contains detailed log messages pertaining to processes such as deployment.

If one such process were to result in an error, the **Traces** section can provide useful information as to why the process failed.

## Latest API calls

The **Latest API calls** section lists the latest HTTP calls made to a deployed web API.
