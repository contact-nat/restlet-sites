APISpark allows you to share your APIs with members of your team (if you subscribed to a Team or Scale [plan](/technical-resources/restlet-studio/guide/get-started/subscribe "plans")). Your team members will only see cells you shared with them and will be allowed to modify them or not depending on the [role](/technical-resources/apispark/guide/explore/team-work#members-rights "role") you granted them.

>**Note:** At the bottom of the window, you can see the number of members you added to your team and the number of members you are allowed according to the plan you subscribed to e.g. 2/5. If you need to add more members, click **Upgrade**.
