Restlet Cloud allows you to share your cells with members of your team.
You can define your [Sharing settings](/documentation/cloud/guide/share/sharing-settings "Sharing settings") from the Settings page.

>**Note:** At the bottom of the window, you can see the number of members you added to your team and the number of members you are allowed according to the plan you subscribed to (Here 3/5).

# Add a member to a cell

To manage the members of a cell, navigate to the cell's **Members** tab.

From here, you can add or remove members.

>**Note:** When you create a new cell [revision](/documentation/cloud/guide/explore/revisions "revision"), it is created with the same members as the former revision. But if you restore an old revision, then you restore it with the members that were associated to this old revision (you loose the members changes you made).

From the cell **Overview** page, click on the **Members** tab.  
In the **Members** section, click on the **Add** button.  
In the window that displays, select your member email address from the **Search** drop-down menu and click on the **Add** button.
