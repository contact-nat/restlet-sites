APISpark is *the* platform for those who want to:  
- **create** new web APIs  
- **document** existing APIs  
- **consume** APIs.

This documentation covers all of these topics in detail in order to help you leverage REST APIs to deliver value to your customers and expand your products.  

To help you start with APISpark, we recommend that you launch an [interactive assistant](/technical-resources/apispark/guide/get-started/interactive-assistants "interactive assistant") or to go through one of our [step-by-step tutorials](/technical-resources/apispark/tutorials "step-by-step tutorials").

When you are ready, you can browse through the different sections of this User Guide and find the information you need. Simply click on one of the topics in the menu on the left, or start by <a href="https://apispark.restlet.com/signup" target="_blank">signing in</a>.
