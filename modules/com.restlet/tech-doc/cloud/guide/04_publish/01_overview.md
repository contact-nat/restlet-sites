# Secure

APIs created with Restlet Cloud can be shared in many different ways. That is why their consumption can be *secured* by controlling [runtime access](/documentation/cloud/guide/publish/secure/runtime-permissions "runtime access") to your APIs (per method or [user group](/documentation/cloud/guide/publish/secure/user-groups "user group")) or limited via [IP filtering](/documentation/cloud/guide/publish/secure/firewall-settings#ip-filtering "IP filtering") or [rate limitations](/documentation/cloud/guide/publish/secure/firewall-settings#rate-limitation "rate limitations").

# Publish

APIs at *design time* can be either [public](/documentation/cloud/guide/publish/publish/documentation "public") (the API Description can be accessed by anyone) or private (it is available through access tokens). *At runtime*, APIs can be [invoked](/documentation/cloud/guide/publish/publish/invocation "invoked") by users who belong to the API's consumer groups with sufficient runtime permissions. Some APIs are however open to anyone without authentication. Restlet Cloud provides [client SDKs](/documentation/cloud/guide/publish/publish/client-sdk "client SDKs") and [server skeletons](/documentation/cloud/guide/publish/publish/server-skeleton "server skeletons") to facilitate APIs invocation by different devices and application.

# Manage  

Restlet Cloud provides you with an [Analytics](/documentation/cloud/guide/publish/manage/analytics "Analytics") page that gives you information about your API's consumption. You can also keep your [community](/documentation/cloud/guide/publish/manage/community-management "community") informed via the Messages tab.
