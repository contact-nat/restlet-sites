	<h4>

	</h4>

	<p>While using the Restlet Framework, you may encounter issues that
		you want to report to us. Those issues can be of several types
		including bugs, enhancement or new feature requests.</p>

	<h5>Check list</h5>

	<p>
		Before entering a new report, you should <a
			href="https://github.com/restlet/restlet-framework-java/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=open">query</a>
		the current issue database for similar open issues. You might also
		want to talk about your issue with the community via the <a
			href="/participate/">discussion forums</a>. Make sure that you also consult
		the <a href="/discover/faq">General FAQ</a> and the Developer FAQ for
		your current version in the <a href="/documentation/">
			documentation section</a>.
	</p>

	<h5>Reporting a new issue</h5>

	<p>
		The Restlet project relies on an issue tracker hosted at GitHub to
		manage all those reports. If you want to create a new report, you
		should first have a GitHub account. If necessary, you can create a new
		one by going to <a href="https://github.com/signup/free">this page</a>.
		Then you should go to the <a
			href="https://github.com/restlet/restlet-framework-java/issues/new">Issue
			Tracker page</a>. If you don't see the page to enter an issue, make sure
		that you are correctly logged into GitHub.

	</h4>
	<!-- contribute -->
	<p>If you found a bug and fixed it locally, or if you developed an
		enhancement that could benefit to others, you are welcome to submit
		your code changes. You simply need to follow these steps:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Verify that your local Git repository builds and passes all
		the unit tests (use the Ant script)</li>
		<li>Consider writing additional unit tests covering your
			contribution.</li>
		<li>Create a pull request on GitHub based on <a
			href="http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/">those
				instructions</a></li>
		<li>Once your patch is accepted, a signed <a
			href="http://restlet.com/participate/jca">Joint Copyright Assignment (JCA)</a> will be required
		</li>
	</ol>

	<p>
		Note that the JCA is necessary in order to maintain a principal
		copyright holder for the whole code base and allow us to propose <a
			href="http://restlet.com/download/legal">several open source
			licenses</a> in parallel, to upgrade to future versions of those licenses
		or to choose new ones.
	</p>

	<p>It also allows Restlet to offer restricted commercial
		licenses to other vendors or organizations wishing to incorporate and
		redistribute Restlet in their proprietary product without the
		constraints of our open source licenses or to develop custom versions
		without wanting to redistribute their changes publicly. In these case,
		it helps us to fund the ongoing development of our open source
		project.</p>

	<h4>Professional Open Source</h4>
	<p>
		In order to balance this significant investment, Restlet has
		developed <a href="http://restlet.com/services/">consulting
			services</a> and <a href="http://restlet.com/products/">technical
			support</a> activities based on the success of the Restlet project. If
		you can afford to become a customer, this is a great way to contribute
		to the funding of the Restlet project.
